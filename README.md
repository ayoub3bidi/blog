This was my first React project after using Vue.js for a long time.  
You can check it out from [here](https://ayoub-blog.netlify.app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm run start
```
Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

```
npm run build
```
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
